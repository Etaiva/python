# Python Learning Journey 🐍

Welcome to my repository!  
This is where I document my progress as a student of Python — recording what I learn, experimenting with code, and keeping track of useful notes and examples.

---

## 📖 About This Repo
- A personal **learning log** for Python programming.
- Contains **scripts, exercises, and mini-projects** I’ve worked on.
- Serves as a **reference library** so I can revisit concepts later.
- A place to **experiment freely** and grow my skills step by step.

---

## 🚀 Goals
- Strengthen my understanding of **Python fundamentals** (syntax, data types, functions, OOP).
- Explore **practical applications** like automation, data analysis, and cybersecurity basics.
- Build a habit of **documenting code** and writing clear explanations.
- Track my journey from beginner to more advanced projects.
